        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p>
          The Go City Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called ring assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the four quadrants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Languages and Frameworks</strong> &mdash; Languages and frameworks that we use for writing code.</li>
          <li><strong>Tools</strong> &mdash; Tools and components that we use to assist with engineering.</li>
          <li><strong>Platforms</strong> &mdash; What we build our applications on top of.</li>
          <li><strong>Techniques</strong> &mdash; Software engineering practices and processes that we follow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With the four rings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong style="color: #93c47d">ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose. Technologies that are used at Go City in our production environment and recommended to be widely used.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #93d2c2">TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success to solve a real problem; first serious usage that confirms benefits and uncovers any limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers at Go City have used these and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #fbdb84">ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often newer and unproven at Go City. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in these technologies and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: #efafa9">DEPRECATE/HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are not recommended to be used at Go City or that we are deprecating. DEPRECATED/HOLD technologies should be phased out of existing projects and not be used for new projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>
        <p>
          The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at Go City to pick the best technologies; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience, to reflect on decisions and continuously evolve our landscape.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
        <p>
          The Tech Radar is maintained by our Principal Engineer who facilitates and drives the technology selection discussions at Go City across the engineering teams. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of Architecure Descision Records (ADRs), which are discussed with all engineers at Go City. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all engineering teams at Go City and relies on their active participation to share lessons learned and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br/>
